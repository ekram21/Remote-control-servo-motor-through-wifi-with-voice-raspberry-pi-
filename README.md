# VoiceControlledServoMotor

This project is a simple way of controlling a servo motor connected to a raspberry pi through your VOICE wirelessly. The example also 
outlines a way of controlling the servo motor through the website so that someone could control it through a phone broswer as
well. This example opens up the user to edit and implement this to voice controlled robots, buggys, home automation with sound etc etc.

It uses a variety of existing online resources. I have just edited and compiled them for this easy tutorial. The languages in use
will be python, some html, some java script, some jquery and very limited css.
